        <ul>
          <li>I landed My very first job when I was 10 years old way back in 1990. MY stepfather bought a bar called the Deluxe Tavern( and believe me my mother hated it) I My job duties were to get up every Saturday and go do a major clean up on the Tavern. I learned Basic custodian skills and my pay was ridiculous I earned $7.50 for 4.5 hours of work, basically a new comic book and a couple rounds of games at the local arcade with my friends. The work ethic that was instilled in my moral aptitude was priceles.</li>
          <li>This is the funniest story, in 1994 I was suspended from school for participating in an altercation with a fellow student. I was living with my father at the time and him in all his infinite wisdom thought it was best to teach me a lesson and make me take the restof the year off from school and get a job as a real man. Well I did just that. This was my first hard labor job ever. He got me a job at triple P roofing My duties were to run bundles and set up and tear down supply the journeymen with rolls of nails and cleanup. I bought my first car at 14 and when it came time to go back to school I wasn't to happy I had the taste of money in my blood already.</li>
          <li>In 1996 I was sent to live with my Grandmother Esther. It just so happened that year My great grandmother opened up a new restaraunt to help my cousin Bobby Find his path in life. It was called the La Pueblait was on Lake avenue, basicaslly skid row in my hometown. Well I started off as the dishwasher and I worked my way to the prep cook and then one evening out of the blue my cousin bobby showed up drunker than a skunk he passed out right in the middle of our dinner rush. well I had no choice but that night I become a lead cook with the help of my aunt Lynne we made it threw the night that was the very first time I realised I could handle responsibility</li>

        <ul>
          <li>On December 15, 2000 I became a Dad first child was born and my life changed. It was no longer about just me anymore. This was the job I tried my hardest to succeed at everything else was part-time from that point on. </li>
          <li>In 2001 I was out of a job and I answered an add in the paper for an asphalt laborer. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. But hey MariAnna Had to eat so i went with it. NOw Asphalt is pone of the hardest and dirtiest jobs out there even today it still has a reputation for having a high turnover rate. Well I didnt think i was going to make it through the week and when the week ended I thought I was going to be fired for not performing up to par. I wasn't fired it was the exact opposite of my expectation. The lead raker was retiring and i was offered his job. There was a 2.00 dollar raise and I took it I became one of the best rakers in the southern colo. area and Ill sytill take the "Pepsi" challenge anytime. I was 21-22 years old and I had my own crew that would go do the custom driveways to million dollar homes along Cheyenne mountain. This Vigorous job , believe it or not taught me finesse and patience. </li>
          <li>In 2017 I answered a work a order from People Ready to andrews food service for clerical work Somewhere along the line I mentioned that I had a Computer information systems certificate I got from the local community college.I never imagined that would open up the door in my mind that it did.I did payroll time sheets D.O.T. hours. I was in charge of dispatch and the best part I got to dress up and I was never tired after work. What I learned here is I didnt want to work hard any longer I wanted to challenge my mind and pursue an occupation that makes me happy.</li>
